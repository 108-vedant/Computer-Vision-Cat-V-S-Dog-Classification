# Computer-Vision-Cat-V-S-Dog-Image-Classification
In this Deep Learning Project a classification model is built using Transfer Learning to distinguish between Dog and Cat images.
The dataset used is kaggle Cat V/s Dog image dataset.
Mobilnet Model is used as a Pretrained Model used for Transfer Learning.
Some of the  libraries used are:
1) Tensorflow
2) Keras
3) CV
4) Zipfile, etc.
